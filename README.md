- 👋 Hi, I’m @traginlaw, but most people just call me Kristina
- 👀 I’m interested in making a mini private website with my families life stories, trips weve taken, Christmas mornings, I'm really excited about it.I know its kinda weird to say this but I was inspired by anne Frank, my dad suggested it as well, not the website part, just physically writing down the stories so I have them when I'm his age. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work in an office, Im hoping to get a remote job after I get done with BootCamp and I am very excited about it as well. I have a basic fleshed out idea on an app I want to create.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on currently not sure when I'll start looking for collaborations, 
- 📫  You can reach me at traginlaw @gmail.com
